  <h2>Azure Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Organizations leveraging <strong>Azure</strong> often integrate with
    <strong>Microsoft Entra ID</strong> for identity and access management,
    commonly alongside <strong>Microsoft 365</strong> or hybrid Active Directory
    environments. These platforms form the backbone of authentication and
    authorization across cloud and on-premises resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of their widespread adoption, attackers frequently target
    misconfigurations and weak security controls in Azure environments. During
    an assessment, I analyze the cloud infrastructure to identify risks, uncover
    vulnerabilities, and provide actionable recommendations to strengthen the
    overall security posture.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Assessment types:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Review:</strong> Performed with privileged access to analyze
      configurations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Penetration Test:</strong> Starts from a low-privilege user to
      escalate access.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Active Directory Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    My Active Directory Assessment offers a comprehensive review of your
    identity infrastructure to ensure it is resilient, well-structured, and
    secure. I evaluate how privilege delegation is implemented, the protection
    and separation of administrative accounts, and the effectiveness of least
    privilege controls. The assessment also includes group policy design,
    Public Key Infrastructure (AD CS) configuration, and the robustness of
    Kerberos authentication settings, highlighting weaknesses that could be
    exploited by attackers.

  <h2>Cloud Security Architect</h2>
  <p>
    As a Cloud Security Architect, I help organizations design and implement
    secure, scalable, and resilient architectures across multi-cloud and hybrid
    environments. I align identity, access, and workload protection with
    industry best practices while integrating centralized logging, SIEM, and
    incident response capabilities. My approach also incorporates endpoint and
    device management, hybrid identity synchronization, least-privilege access,
    CNAPP and CSPM frameworks, Zero Trust principles, and governance models that
    strengthen security posture and support compliance.

  <h2>Other Services</h2>
  <p>
    I specialize in securing Microsoft technologies such as Windows, Active
    Directory, and Azure. If your needs extend beyond these areas, I can also
    provide tailored security assessments. Over the years, I have gained
    experience across a wide range of engagements, including red and purple team
    exercises, mobile and web application testing, and assessments of
    non-Microsoft environments.

  <h2>Want to Do Security Research Together?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm always interested in connecting with people who want to collaborate on 
    security research. If you have new ideas or projects in mind, feel free to 
    reach out and we can explore them together.
