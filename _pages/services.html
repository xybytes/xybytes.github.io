  <h2>Active Directory and Entra ID (Formerly Azure AD) Assessments</h2>
  <p>
    Almost all companies that use Microsoft products or services on-premises use
    <strong>Active Directory</strong> as their identity provider. Additionally,
    companies using <strong>Microsoft 365 or Azure-based services</strong> use
    Microsoft Entra ID as an identity platform, often in a hybrid configuration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since these products are widely used, threat actors frequently exploit
    common misconfigurations. During an assessment,
    <strong>Outsider Security</strong>
    evaluates the infrastructure’s security posture and provides actionable
    recommendations.

  <h2>Active Directory Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Active Directory environments often accumulate insecure settings over years
    of use. Outsider Security identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
    frequently abused by attackers, including ransomware operators.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Typical focus areas:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Privilege delegation model</li>
    <li>Admin account protection and separation</li>
    <li>Least privilege configuration</li>
    <li>Group policy settings</li>
    <li>PKI configuration (AD CS)</li>
    <li>Kerberos configuration</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Assessment types:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Review:</strong> Performed with privileged access to analyze
      configurations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Penetration Test:</strong> Starts from a low-privilege user to
      escalate access.
    </li>
  </ul>
